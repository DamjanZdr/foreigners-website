# Blog Post Formatting Guide

## Structure for Q&A Style Articles

Your blog posts should follow this proven structure for SEO and readability:

### 1. Title (Automatic)
The title is set in the `title` field - it automatically displays as H1.

### 2. Introduction Paragraph
Start your `content` field with a compelling introduction paragraph.
**Do NOT use a heading** - just write the paragraph directly.

Example:
```
Waiting for a Temporary Residence Card (TRC) in Poland can feel like an endless process. Many foreigners submit their full application expecting a decision within monthsonly to discover that Polish immigration offices often take far longer. Understanding how long the TRC waiting time really is, why delays happen, and what you can do to avoid unnecessary problems can save you months of uncertainty.
```

### 3. Featured Image (Optional)
If you add a `featured_image` URL, it will display after the title and before content.

### 4. First Question/Section
Use `##` for question headings (H2):

```markdown
## What is the typical Poland TRC card processing time?

The Poland TRC card processing time currently takes between 1 to 3 years, depending on where you apply and how complex your case is. In busy voivodeships such as Mazowieckie (Warsaw) or Małopolskie (Kraków), the TRC waiting time can sometimes exceed two years due to overloaded offices and long queues.
```

### 5. Inline Images
Add images within content using markdown:

```markdown
![TRC Processing Time](https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg)
```

### 6. More Q&A Sections
Continue with 2-4 more questions using the same format:

```markdown
## Can you stay in Poland while waiting for your TRC card?

Yes, if you submit your application before your current visa or residence permit expires, you can legally stay in Poland while waiting for a decision. The stamp you receive in your passport proves your legal stay but does not allow international travel unless you have a valid visa or another residence card.

At **foreigners.pl** we guide our clients on how to remain fully compliant during this period and help them with any issues that may arise while waiting.
```

### 7. Conclusion Paragraph
End with a summary paragraph without a heading.
